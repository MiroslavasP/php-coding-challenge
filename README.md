The following is a fictional delivery calendar project for customers who subscribed to "X" service.

When a user creates a subscription, they have a calendar on their online account where
they can see what deliveries they have coming up for the following 6 weeks. 
They have the ability to "untick" an upcoming delivery and mark it as a holiday, 
or "tick" an unticked upcoming delivery day for upcoming deliveries they have 
already created a holiday for.
